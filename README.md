# Smart Attendance System

Smart Attendance Management System is an application developed for daily attendance of student/
staff in colleges or schools or any other organizations. This project attempts to record attendance
through face detection and live location. The objective of this project is to develop a system for
managing attendance that can be used by all individuals in educational institutions or in any
organization. This software requires to store the user's own image to be detected. The system will
load the userâ€™s image at the sign-up step. For giving attendance the user needs to sign in and the
real time image of the user will be captured to take the attendance and it will be matched with the
stored image of the person. The proposed system records attendance without allowing any chance
of proxy attendance by the students. The administrator maintains the database. After verifying the
user, the attendance will be taken, and it will be saved in an excel sheet with their live location and
time of attendance. In this approach, face recognition and face detection are used. This face
detection differentiates faces from non-faces and is therefore essential for accurate attendance.
The other strategy involves face recognition for marking the accurate attendance of the students.
